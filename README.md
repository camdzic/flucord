# flucord

A high-level, object-oriented, type-safe, and easy-to-use Discord.js framework for TypeScript

## Explanation

I created this framework for personal use, but decided to make it public in case anyone else would like to use it. Although it's still in development, it is already usable. I will continue adding more features and improvements in the future. *Flucord is only usable with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).*

## Example

You can find an example bot in the [boilerplate repository](https://github.com/camdzic/flucord-boilerplate).

## Wiki & Documentation

You can find the wiki and documentation on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/camdzic/flucord/wiki).

## Features

* Slash & Context Menu Commands
* Events
* Crons
* Triggers *(static interaction handlers)*
* Guard System
* Component Builder System *(dynamic interaction builders)*
* Config System
* Built-in utilities

## Installation

You can install Flucord using bun:

```bash
bun add flucord discord.js
```

## Credits

Flucord is heavily inspired by [Colossus](https://github.com/RyanLandDev/Colossus).
*Colossus* is JDA framework for creating Discord bots with ease.
